Some of the github things were new, like forked repo which were nice!
Otherwise im pretty well versed (to a degree) in git, im often the one that handles and are in charge of the git in out past projects.
Github pages were new, also a good way to try webpages!
We have also been using gitlab in the software engineering 2 course for that project.
Ive been asked recently to take a look on how to create a website so ive been reading some on firebase etc and started a base project there with working index, but that is as far as my knowledge goes.
Downloaded a website editor, Komodo. They are fairly large and are stacked with information (a bit much honestly).
My past experience in web application is very limited to none, which makes this course even more interesting and motivating!
What i have learned is mostly the existence of github pages, a brief intro on atom and basic html.
Getting the forked repo to work is also a new experience and how that can help in certain environments.
The git as said, was not that hard to set up, the source repo was new though and can also be valuable at times.
