<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</span></p>

<p>Some of the github things were new, like forked repo which were nice!
    Otherwise im pretty well versed (to a degree) in git, im often the one that handles and are in charge of the git in out past projects.
    Github pages were new, also a good way to try webpages!
    We have also been using gitlab in the software engineering 2 course for that project.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Have you ever created websites before?</span></p>

<p>Ive been asked recently to take a look on how to create a website so ive been reading some on firebase etc and started a base project there with working index, but that is as far as my knowledge goes.
    Downloaded a website editor, Komodo. They are fairly large and are stacked with information (a bit much honestly).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</span></p>

   <p> My past experience in web application is very limited to none, which makes this course even more interesting and motivating!</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p> What i have learned is mostly the existence of github pages, a brief intro on atom and basic html.
    Getting the forked repo to work is also a new experience and how that can help in certain environments.
    The git as said, was not that hard to set up, the source repo was new though and can also be valuable at times.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</span></p>

<p>As said in precious section my experience in html, css and js is very limited, we had a brief intro to javascript in jsp when we did the restful api as well as some HTML.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</span></p>

   <p>HTML forms the base or skeleton of the website. Provides what elements exist on the page and the overall structure.
   CSS instead alters said elements and provides ways to change the skeleton. Change fonts, sizes, positions and style of said elements.
   Javascript is more diverse, here you can define how objects and elements will behave, for example animations. </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</span></p>

<p>User enters a URL in the browser, browser contacts a DNS-server. Browser sends a get request to adress provided by DNS-server.
   To send a get request the browser utilizes the HTTP protocol and the webserver either accepts the requests or denies it. If it accepts (200 OK) the browser gets the page from the webserver.



   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Well first of all when creating the footer, i learned how to utilize the mailto function to initiate an email from an emailadress.
    How to link to resources like images, that jpeg files can be really annoying and doesn't always work with rotate since it is preordained, so had to create my image in PNG instead.
        </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</span></p>

   <p>No i have no prior experience of client side javascript, atleast not any that counts.  </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</span></p>

   <p>Well the only language i know so far is java, you can see some similiarites ofcourse. For loops, if statements and similar statements are written the same as in java, variables is written a bit different and is not defined in the same way however.  </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</span></p>

   <p>Well at first i searched for how to create a table from a json object which stack overflow provided some nice solutions, the duck exercise was easy to fix with the help of the example and just had to edit some small parts. Code vise it could probably be neater, as usual. 
       Because im 4 weeks late into the course i will only aim for the grade 3 at this time since im severly behind. If i find time to update i will try and go for a 5 as i always do.
   </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Getting a bit more oriented with javascript was very nice. Xampp is a very good application to try out certain functions and bypass the Cors error. Getting more oriented with CSS and html as well, read up how to use elements and will probably use it in the future.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</span></p>

   <p>I have no prior experience unfortuantely in node/npm or anything like it.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</span></p>

   <p>It is getting more interesting now when you start to see the structure and starting to see more patterns in javascript. Node and express was also nice and being able to start a webserver really easily for later testing purposes can be really valuable.  </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</span></p>

   <p>Well since i aimed for a 3 in grade most was explained in previous tutorial. Otherwise it mostly went the way i wanted and thought it would. Only problem was linking to the actual report page, i had to use __dirname etc, a few extra steps. Was not really an issue since a simple search solved it.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</span></p>

   <p>As i said before, am 4 weeks late into the course so i will only aim for grade 3 unfortunately, otherwise i like to aim for 5's. It really was not that difficult, had a small pathing error only that took a little time.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Getting more familiarized with node, npm and express ofcourse was very valuable. I learned how to create arrays and how to send html pages. how to start express through terminal etc. A bit more about pathing. </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</span></p>

   <p></p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</span></p>
