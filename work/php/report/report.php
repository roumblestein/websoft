<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</span></p>

<p>Some of the github things were new, like forked repo which were nice!
    Otherwise im pretty well versed (to a degree) in git, im often the one that handles and are in charge of the git in out past projects.
    Github pages were new, also a good way to try webpages!
    We have also been using gitlab in the software engineering 2 course for that project.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Have you ever created websites before?</span></p>

<p>Ive been asked recently to take a look on how to create a website so ive been reading some on firebase etc and started a base project there with working index, but that is as far as my knowledge goes.
    Downloaded a website editor, Komodo. They are fairly large and are stacked with information (a bit much honestly).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</span></p>

   <p> My past experience in web application is very limited to none, which makes this course even more interesting and motivating!</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p> What i have learned is mostly the existence of github pages, a brief intro on atom and basic html.
    Getting the forked repo to work is also a new experience and how that can help in certain environments.
    The git as said, was not that hard to set up, the source repo was new though and can also be valuable at times.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S02</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</span></p>

<p>As said in precious section my experience in html, css and js is very limited, we had a brief intro to javascript in jsp when we did the restful api as well as some HTML.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</span></p>

   <p>HTML forms the base or skeleton of the website. Provides what elements exist on the page and the overall structure.
   CSS instead alters said elements and provides ways to change the skeleton. Change fonts, sizes, positions and style of said elements.
   Javascript is more diverse, here you can define how objects and elements will behave, for example animations. </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</span></p>

<p>User enters a URL in the browser, browser contacts a DNS-server. Browser sends a get request to adress provided by DNS-server.
   To send a get request the browser utilizes the HTTP protocol and the webserver either accepts the requests or denies it. If it accepts (200 OK) the browser gets the page from the webserver.



   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Well first of all when creating the footer, i learned how to utilize the mailto function to initiate an email from an emailadress.
    How to link to resources like images, that jpeg files can be really annoying and doesn't always work with rotate since it is preordained, so had to create my image in PNG instead.
        </p>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</span></p>

   <p>No i have no prior experience of client side javascript, atleast not any that counts.  </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</span></p>

   <p>Well the only language i know so far is java, you can see some similiarites ofcourse. For loops, if statements and similar statements are written the same as in java, variables is written a bit different and is not defined in the same way however.  </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</span></p>

   <p>Well at first i searched for how to create a table from a json object which stack overflow provided some nice solutions, the duck exercise was easy to fix with the help of the example and just had to edit some small parts. Code vise it could probably be neater, as usual. 
       Because im 4 weeks late into the course i will only aim for the grade 3 at this time since im severly behind. If i find time to update i will try and go for a 5 as i always do.
   </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Getting a bit more oriented with javascript was very nice. Xampp is a very good application to try out certain functions and bypass the Cors error. Getting more oriented with CSS and html as well, read up how to use elements and will probably use it in the future.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</span></p>

   <p>I have no prior experience unfortuantely in node/npm or anything like it.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</span></p>

   <p>It is getting more interesting now when you start to see the structure and starting to see more patterns in javascript. Node and express was also nice and being able to start a webserver really easily for later testing purposes can be really valuable.  </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</span></p>

   <p>Well since i aimed for a 3 in grade most was explained in previous tutorial. Otherwise it mostly went the way i wanted and thought it would. Only problem was linking to the actual report page, i had to use __dirname etc, a few extra steps. Was not really an issue since a simple search solved it.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</span></p>

   <p>As i said before, am 4 weeks late into the course so i will only aim for grade 3 unfortunately, otherwise i like to aim for 5's. It really was not that difficult, had a small pathing error only that took a little time.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Getting more familiarized with node, npm and express ofcourse was very valuable. I learned how to create arrays and how to send html pages. how to start express through terminal etc. A bit more about pathing. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</span></p>

   <p>It seems interesting and new, feels like you can do a lot of backend programming with the help of PHP and feels more suited for it than javascript.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</span></p>

   <p>Not really, it is quite different towards precious languages, probably the reason it was harder to get into.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</span></p>

   <p>I aimed for grade 3 as usual because of time limitation. The examples was almost too good and provided almost every building stone needed to build the search function. </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Some basic PHP, more table making and how to use JSON in PHP. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S06</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</span></p>

   <p>Thats a hard question, java is still the most popular in a sense even tho it is decreasing, i think java is starting to get outdated and will be overtaken by newer languages. Also i think that languages will be more tailored towards certain uses (already is in a sense but it will increse).</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</span></p>

   <p>Hard to tell, will probably depend on the job. cant see me only using one language either, will probably have to adapt to whatever language is required of me.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold"> Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </span></p>

   <p>i did a comparison between java, python and c. Python is the clear winner even tho java is still a contender, however, C has really low interest. Python averaged at 84, java at 54 and C at 18. Tells the story that python is a newer and overall more interresting programming language.  </p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</span></p>

   <p>Well since java is the language we have used in the majority of the education this would be my first choice to work in, however i would very much like to develop skills in another language but my overall worth and effecieny would be lowered until i have learned the basics of the new system.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>well python is a very popular language, my own thoughts and view put down.</p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</span></p>

   <p>Its a platform that uses C# and HTML/CSS. You can use both c# and html code directly into the pages, even use C# code inside html code.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</span></p>

   <p>Personally i prefer the .net since it makes more sence to me with C#, PHP i did not like as much since it provided more rules. Net also feels like it is easier to get into and that you can structure code better.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</span></p>

   <p>Aimed for grade 3 as per usual. I liked .net, reminded a lot about coding in intellij and felt more natural. Felt that the result were good and did not use examples as help but the videos instead which provided more information.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>basic .net programming, how to use json, pages, controllers and services. What the point is of the startup file and the importance to make sure certain features are included in startup. </p>

<p> Findings and elaboration </p>
            <p> The best of our three websites was definitely Expressen, it loaded the fastest, and performed best
                on almost every aspect. Aftonbladet was not very far behind, as it also was a quick and good website.
                Kristianstadbladet on the other hand, was not very close to the other two websites. It was a slow 
                website compared to them. 
                
                We used pagespeed to see the biggest problems of the websites and how to solve them.
                Aftonbladet had a quick site and could not improve that much. The biggest time-saver they could
                do is to eliminate render-blocking resources, and thereby save 1.07 seconds. They could also improve
                some image-problems. But overall they have a very quick site.
                Expressens website is excellent, their only time-saver would be to defer offscreen images. But other 
                than that, their website runs very quick. 
                Kristianstadbladet has some very bad statistics compared to Aftonbladet and Expressen. Their website runs 
                significally slower and could save a lot of time on some issues. They could save 11.25 seconds on serving
                images in next-gen formats. And 10.92 seconds on defering offscreen images.
                  </p>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</span></p>

   <p>(Sensitive Data Exposure) One of the largest security issues is the ones involving sensitive information. How do certain sites handle your data and in which way. Is their connections to databases safe, how do they handle the data from databases etc etc.
  (Broken Authentication) Another large problem is the verification of persons. How do you retrieve a password that you have forgotten, is the person who is trying to retrieve a password the real person or a hacker. registrating with the same email everywhere also increases the risk that hackers will retrieve your email from somewhere.
   I have a 20 year old email since i was little and i probably get 3 scam mails and 4 password retrieval mails a day that is not my own. It is infested like from some horror movie. 
   Also the current requirements for password from websites are still to little, 8 characters and enough with 1 letter or number. This is way to easy for hackers to break with algorithms. Websites should request upper & lowercase, Special letters and numbers, at minimum 12-13 characters, this would make attacks with algorithms much harder.
   (Components) Using librarys or components with little understanding can result in large security flaws. Same with copypasting code can also lead to bugs and unintended uses that attackers can find. 
    </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</span></p>

   <p>1) make users create safe passwords.
   2) ask for help if you need it.
   3) encryption and decryption is your friend, learn it.
   4) if you have a service or have users in any way. Pay people to break your website and try to find weaknesses.
   5) dont copy-paste code if you dont fully understand it, understand what your code does and it will also be easier to predict how it will react in certain cases.
   6) make mistakes and learn from it, just make sure it doesn't involve my personal information.
   7) search it up and learn which security issues you will be most affected by.</p>

   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is your TIL for this course section?</span></p>

   <p>Different vulnerabilities and what they are caused by. How hackers and attackers try to steal information and manipulate functions and bugs. Less is more in the sense of adding services and methods and how you should seperate them.   </p>
