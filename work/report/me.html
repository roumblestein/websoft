<h1>My report page in the course XXX</h1>

<p><img src="img\Martin_Mollie.jpg"  width="500" alt="Dog on an image"></p>

<p>This page contains a presentation of myself.</p>

<p>My name is Martin Rubin, born and raised in Kristianstad, Sk√•ne. My parental home was in Torsebro just outside of Kristianstad. I played table tennis and football when i was younger, when i became older computers became more interesting. I studied to carpenter after highschool, which were not something I in the end wanted to do. Started instead studying biomedical analyst on HKR. Unfortunately I had already studied some courses on komvux and were so tired that I instead gave up on the studies and started working. Begun working as a care assistant in home care and later in a nursing home. After 3 years i became extremely tired of both pay and the overall environment in care. So I went back to computers and are now more than motiviated to get a degree so I dont have to work in care again!</p>

<p>Programming is not something I had done prior to this education, but is something that really intrigues me.</p>

<p>Hobbies besides gaming i dont really have. My wife is pregnant and will give birth now in the middle of februari so I probably do not really have time for it either.</p>
